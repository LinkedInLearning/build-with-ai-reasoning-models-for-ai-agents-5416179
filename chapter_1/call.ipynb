      "\n",
      "1. **Calculate Tony's initial total:**\n",
      "   * 6 1/10 = 61/10\n",
      "   * 1 1/4 = 5/4\n",
      "   * 3 1/2 = 7/2\n",
      "   * Common denominator: 20\n",
      "   * (122/20) + (25/20) + (70/20) = 217/20 pieces\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Calculate Janice's initial total:**\n",
      "   * 4 1/10 = 41/10\n",
      "   * 2 1/4 = 9/4\n",
      "   * 2 1/2 = 5/2\n",
      "   * Common denominator: 20\n",
      "   * (82/20) + (45/20) + (50/20) = 177/20 pieces\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tony gives Janice 3/5 of a pie:**\n",
      "   * 3/5 = 12/20\n",
      "   * Tony's new total: 217/20 - 12/20 = 205/20\n",
      "   * Janice's new total: 177/20 + 12/20 = 189/20\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Janice gives Tony her 1/10th pieces:**\n",
      "   * Janice had 4 1/10th pieces, which is 41/10 = 82/20\n",
      "   * Notice Janice had 189/20 = (177/20) + (12/20), these were all in 1/4s and 1/2s before Tony's last gift\n",
      "   * So, from 189/20 = 9+9/20, Janice only has four 1/10 pieces = 4/10 * 2 = 8/20. This can also be expressed as 82/20 which she had at the start.\n",
      "   * Tony's new total: 205/20 + 8/20= 213/20 pieces\n",

      "   * 213/20 = 10 13/20 pieces\n",
