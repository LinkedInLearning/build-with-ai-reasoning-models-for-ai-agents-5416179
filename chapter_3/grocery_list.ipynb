      "\n",
      "*   **Butter:** You can use vegan butter brands such as Earth Balance, Miyoko's, Country Crock Plant Butter, or Becel Vegan margarine. For cooking, olive oil, vegetable shortening, coconut oil, or other vegetable oils can also be used.\n",
      "*   **Heavy Cream:**\n",
      "    *   **Coconut Cream:** This is a rich, creamy option and can often be substituted in a 1:1 ratio. Be aware that it may impart a subtle coconut flavor.\n",
      "    *   **Cashew Cream:** Made by soaking and blending cashews, cashew cream offers a rich and neutral flavor, making it a versatile substitute for heavy cream in sauces like Alfredo.\n",
      "    *   **Plant-based Milk and Oil:** A mixture of non-dairy milk (such as soy, almond, oat, or cashew milk) and a neutral oil (like olive oil) can mimic the richness of heavy cream for cooking.\n",
      "    *   **Commercial Dairy-Free Cream Alternatives:** Products like Silk Dairy-Free Heavy Whipping Cream Alternative are specifically designed for dairy-free cooking and can be used in Alfredo sauce.\n",
      "*   **Parmesan Cheese:**\n",
      "    *   **Homemade Vegan Parmesan:** You can create a dairy-free Parmesan substitute by blending ingredients like pine nuts or cashews with hemp seeds, nutritional yeast (which provides a cheesy flavor), garlic powder, and salt.\n",
      "    *   **Store-bought Dairy-Free Parmesan:** Brands like Follow Your Heart offer grated dairy-free Parmesan alternatives that mimic the sharp, nutty taste of traditional Parmesan.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Gluten-Free Substitutions\n",
      "\n",
      "To make your fettuccine alfredo gluten-free, the primary substitution is the pasta:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fettuccine Noodles:** Many brands offer gluten-free fettuccine made from alternative flours. Common options include pasta made from corn and rice flour (e.g., Barilla Gluten Free Fettuccine) or brown rice flour (e.g., Trader Joe's Gluten Free Egg Fettuccine Pasta, Taste Republic Fresh Gluten-Free Fettuccine). You can also make homemade gluten-free pasta using specialized gluten-free pasta flour blends.\n"
